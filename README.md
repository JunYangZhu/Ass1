MAMAMOO Website

Website for K-Pop group MAMAMOO. MAMAMOO is a 4-member group comprised of 4 female members, Hwasa (vocals and rap), Solar (vocals and leader), Wheein (vocals and performance) and Moonbyul (performance and rap). They are widely known for their vocals and amazing performances and concerts they hold and their unique ad-libs in every performance. This website is created with the purpose of promoting the group's activities and events to allow fans to have a designated website that provides timely information regarding all the news related to the group.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process
